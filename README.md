Quick repo for practicing Gitflow.

1. Fork it (and feel free to delete after). Set up CircleCI.
2. Clone it locally: `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/quick-repo.
3. Create your own branch: `git checkout -b BRANCH`.
4. Make a small change, e.g. make the test fail.
5. Push your change up to your branch: `git push`.
6. Create a pull request on GitHub.
7. Approve your PR and squash merge. Note: you won't actually be able to do this, you'll need to make sure your PR is passing all status checks, get it approved by your lead and one other team member, and then merge.
